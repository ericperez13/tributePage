        <!--some basic info about Shrek, like all 4 movie synopses-->
        <p>The Shrek film series follows the unconventional adventures of Shrek, an ogre with a heart of gold, and his loyal sidekick Donkey. In the first film, Shrek's solitary swamp life is disrupted when he is tasked with rescuing Princess Fiona for the villainous Lord Farquaad. As the duo embarks on the quest, they discover the importance of self-acceptance and true love. <em>Shrek 2</em> sees Shrek and Fiona meeting her royal parents, navigating challenges that test their relationship and highlighting the themes of love and identity. <em>Shrek the Third</em> explores Shrek's reluctance to rule the kingdom and the quest for a suitable heir, while dealing with the revenge-seeking Prince Charming. The series concludes with <em>Shrek Forever After</em>, where a disillusioned Shrek makes a pact with Rumpelstiltskin, leading to an alternate reality where he must rectify the consequences of his choices and rediscover the significance of love and family. Throughout the series, Shrek's humorous and clever encounters with fairy tale elements provide entertainment for audiences of all ages.</p>
